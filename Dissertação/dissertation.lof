\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Venn diagram of the Poincar√© group and some of its subgroups. The Lorentz group elements P, T, and PT are the discrete transformations which take the identity component of the Lorentz group (i.e. the Restricted Lorentz Group) into the other three topologically separate components. Elements of the Restricted Lorentz Group include pure boosts, pure rotations, and general combinations of the two.\relax }}{25}%

Alice's ship is traveling with velocity $\vec {v}_1$ with respect to mission control, and Bob's ship is traveling with velocity $\vec {v}_2$ with respect to Alice's ship. Mission control sees Bob's ship traveling with velocity $\vec {v}_{21}$ and rotated by an angle $\Omega $. Figure taken from \cite {visser_2011}.\relax }}{27}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces Wigner rotation angle as a function of the boosted frame's velocity, for the case of a boost perpendicular to the particle's momentum. A particle with non-relativistic energy ($p/mc = 0.1$) results in negligible rotation, even for ultra-relativistic boosts ($\beta \rightarrow 1$). When the particle and the boost both approach ultra-relativistic velocities, the Wigner rotation angle approaches its maximal value of $\pi /2$.\relax }}{34}%

On the right, the phase $\xi $ is held constant ($\xi = \frac {\pi }{2}$) and $S(\rho _S)$ is plotted as function of $\theta $ and $\beta $.
